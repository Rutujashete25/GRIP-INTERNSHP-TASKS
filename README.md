## Task 1: Prediction using supervised ML
In this task we have to predict the percentage of student based on no. of study hours. As the dataset contain only two variables we have used Simple linear regression 
As per the simple linear regression is concern, is depend upon the two variables dependant and independant. so, here we can say that according to our problem statement "Hours" is the Independant variable / predictor(X) & "Score" is the Dependent variable / Target(Y).
Tool : Jupyter Notebook
Language : Python

## Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
From the given "Iris" datatset we have to predict the optimum number of clusters (k) and represent it visually.
Iris is a multivariate dataset which has five attributes.
In order to find the optimum number of clusters, there are various methods available. Here we are going to use the elbow method.
The Elbow Method : In this method, the number of clusters are varies within a certain range. for each number, within-cluster sum of square (wss) value is calculated and stored in a list.These values are then plotted against the range of number of clusters used before.
