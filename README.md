# GRIP-INTERNSHP-TASKS
In this Graduate Rotational Internship program by sparks foundation, I have performed task 1 from data science and buisness analytics tasks.
## Task 1: Prediction uaing Supervised ML
The task is to predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves only two variables.
you can use python. R, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
Tools used : Juyter Notebook
language : python
## Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised ML
The task is From the given "Iris" datatset we have to predict the optimum number of clusters (k) and represent it visually.
Iris is a multivariate dataset which has five attributes. 
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.
Algorithm Used: K-Means 
Tool Used: Jupyter Notebook
Language : Python
